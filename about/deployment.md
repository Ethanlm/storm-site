title: Easy to deploy and operate
---

Apache Storm clusters are easy to deploy, requiring a minimum of setup and configuration to get up and running. Apache Storm's out of the box configurations are suitable for production. Read more about how to deploy an Apache Storm cluster [here](/documentation/Setting-up-a-Storm-cluster.html).

Additionally, Apache Storm is easy to operate once deployed. Apache Storm has been designed to be [extremely robust](/about/fault-tolerant.html) â€“ the cluster will just keep on running, month after month.
