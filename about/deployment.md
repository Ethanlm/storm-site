title: Easy to deploy and operate
---

Storm clusters are easy to deploy, requiring a minimum of setup and configuration to get up and running. Storm's out of the box configurations are suitable for production. Read more about how to deploy a Storm cluster [here](/documentation/Setting-up-a-Storm-cluster.html).

Additionally, Storm is easy to operate once deployed. Storm has been designed to be [extremely robust](/about/fault-tolerant.html) â€“ the cluster will just keep on running, month after month.
